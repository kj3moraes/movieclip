# Dataset

The movieclip dataset is published to HuggingFace here - 

This documentation shows how to generate the dataset yourself. Feel free to edit the methodology for your own purposes.
The dataset is generated by:

1. scraping [FILM-GRAB](https://film-grab.com/)'s A-Z section and saving all the images from this website.
2. querying the TMDB database for each movie for the movie ID, specifically the director, cinematographer and genres.
3. saving all this information into a directory and JSON for the movie information.

## Setup

You need to create a .env file in this directory and populate it as follows:

```env
TMDB_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
TMDB_READ_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

You can create a TMDB account [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and then make an API key and read token.
